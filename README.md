Austin Crime Analysis Project (2014-2019)

The Austin Crime Analyis Project was my graduate level course project for the Data Analytics Applications class as part of the UTSA Masters in Data Analytics Program.
The project consisted of the following:

* Conducted data analysis on the city of Austinâ€™s crime rates (2015-2019) utilizing visualizations and predictive modeling
* Cleaned and pre-processed 2 million records of data via removing missing data, data splitting, factor mutations, and data sub-setting
* Ran random forest and logistic regression models in order to determine whether family related crimes could be predicted depending on location and day
